### In this example, we define a lithography pattern as a 100x100 array with a square in the center. We also define a Gaussian laser beam profile using the beam function.
### We then define a lithography function that takes the pattern and the beam sigma as inputs, and returns the resulting intensity pattern as an array. This function uses NumPy's meshgrid function to generate the x and y coordinates of the pixels, and applies the beam profile to each pixel.
### Finally, we generate the intensity pattern using the lithography function with a beam sigma of 10, and plot the pattern and intensity side by side using Matplotlib.
### Note that this is just a simple example to demonstrate how to generate a lithography pattern using Python. In practice, you would typically spend more time on designing the pattern, optimizing the beam profile, and controlling the exposure time and other lithography parameters.
